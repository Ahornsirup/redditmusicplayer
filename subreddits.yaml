    Have you seen everything to the point of having to look for the obscure and
    the not so often seen? Well perhaps this reddit is for you. Post your
    favorites. Discuss, request info whatever.  Silent films? 60's &amp; 70's
    exploitation flicks? Old classics? Old TV. Pretty much anything   Give it
    a try.  Please include the year in your submission title.
